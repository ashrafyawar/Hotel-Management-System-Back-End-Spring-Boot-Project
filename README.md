# Hotel Management System

This project is a hotel management system that allows users to make bookings, check-in, check-out, pay for their stay, and access various amenities and services offered by the hotel. The system also provides administrators with the ability to manage rooms, users, amenities, and assign cleaning tasks to housekeeping staff.

## Problem Definition

The problem that this project aims to solve is the manual management of hotel operations, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. By automating these processes, the hotel can improve efficiency and reduce the risk of mistakes.

## Design Explanation

The design of the hotel management system in this project is centered around the concept of room bookings and the various entities that are involved in the process. The system includes tables for storing information about users, rooms, amenities, and bookings.

- Users Table: Stores information about different types of system users.
- Rooms Table: Contains details about the hotel's different rooms.
- Amenities Table: Provides information about the amenities available in the hotel.
- RoomAmenities Table: Represents a many-to-many relationship between rooms and amenities.
- Bookings Table: Stores information about the bookings made for the hotel's rooms.
- HousekeepingSchedules Table: Maintains information about the tasks assigned to housekeeping staff.

## User Views

In terms of user views, the different types of users in the system will have different levels of access to the data in these tables. For example:

- Guests: Can view their own bookings and available amenities.
- Administrators: Have comprehensive access to all data in the system.
- Receptionists: Have similar access to administrators but with restrictions on editing sensitive data.
- Housekeepers: Can view and edit the tasks assigned to them.

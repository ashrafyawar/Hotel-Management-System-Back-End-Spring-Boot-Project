# Hotel-Management-System-Back-End-Spring-Boot-Project
This project is about a hotel management system that allows users to make bookings, check in, check out, pay for their stay, and access various amenities and services offered by the hotel. The system also allows administrators to manage the rooms, users, and amenities, as well as assign cleaning tasks to housekeeping staff.
